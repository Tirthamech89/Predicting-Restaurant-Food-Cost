# Predicting Restaurant Food Cost Hackathon

Who doesn’t love food? All of us must have craving for at least a few favourite food items, we may also have a few places where we like to get them, a restaurant which serves our favourite food the way we want it to be. But there is one factor that will make us reconsider having our favourite food from our favourite restaurant, the cost. Here in this hackathon, you will be predicting the cost of the food served by the restaurants across different cities in India. You will use your Data Science skills to investigate the factors that really affect the cost, and who knows maybe you will even gain some very interesting insights that might help you choose what to eat and from where.
